## 1️⃣ **Order Status Service** (Python / FastAPI)
- **🧠 Purpose**: Manages orders and their lifecycle statuses (requested, accepted, completed, paid, alert) with strict state transition rules and role-based permissions.
- **🧪 Port**: `5017`
- **🧰 Tech Stack**:
- &nbsp; - Language: Python
- &nbsp; - Framework: FastAPI
- &nbsp; - DB: PostgreSQL
- **🛢️ Database**:
- &nbsp; - Type: Relational
- &nbsp; - Engine: PostgreSQL
- &nbsp; - Hosted on a remote server (configurable via environment variables)
- **🔐 Security**:
- &nbsp; - Role-based state update restrictions (requester vs creator)
- &nbsp; - Validation of allowed state transitions to avoid invalid order lifecycle changes
- **📡 Communication**: REST (JSON)
- &nbsp; - Endpoints for creating orders, querying status, and updating order states
- **🌍 Endpoints**:
- &nbsp; - `POST /orders/` — Create a new order
- &nbsp; - `GET /orders/{order_id}/status` — Retrieve current status of an order
- &nbsp; - `PUT /orders/{order_id}/update` — Update the status of an order with permission and transition checks
- **🎨 Design Pattern**: `SOLID` principles applied, especially Single Responsibility and Dependency Inversion
- **🏗️ Architecture**: 3-layer (N-layer) architecture
- &nbsp; - Presentation Layer (API routes)
- &nbsp; - Domain Layer (business logic and validation in services)
- &nbsp; - Data Access Layer (repository pattern for database operations)
- **🛠️ Notes**:
- &nbsp; - Uses SQLAlchemy ORM for DB interactions
- &nbsp; - Dependency injection for DB session and service instances
- &nbsp; - Designed for maintainability, testability, and clear separation of concerns
